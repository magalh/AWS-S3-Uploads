<h3>What Does This Do?</h3>
<p>This CMSMS plugin allows you to use Amazon’s Simple Storage Service to host your media for your CMSMS setup.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 is a cheap and cost effective way to scale your site to easily handle large spikes in traffic without having to go through the expense of setting up the infrastructure for a content delivery network.</p>

<p>Once setup, this plugin transparently integrates with your CMSMS. File uploads are automatically saved into your Amazon S3 bucket without any extra steps. Once saved, these files will be delivered by Amazon S3, instead of your web host.</p>

<h3>How Do I Use It</h3>
<p>Configure the plugin in the ‘Options’ (or ‘Settings’) screen by following the onscreen prompts.<br>Once setup is completed, you can embed the {AWSS3} tag in your pages. You can use the Parameters below to customize your experience.</p>
